# Memory optimization in Java
* Measure with original code(partly rewritten to Java)
* Measure original code with difference and with bigger bounds(10 vs 100)
* Measure after replacing column order
* Measure after changing int type to byte
* Measure after replacing increment order(asc to desc)
## As you can see execution time was reduced by 3 times - from 32109764 to 10670416.
## This result for memory optimization show that it make sense
